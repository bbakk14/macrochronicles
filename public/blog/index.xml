      <description>When the market crashed in late-February and March, a lot of Americans decided it was time to open up a brokerage account or more actively trade their existing one. Apart from trading volumes, Tesla’s stock going to the moon, and Hertz’s rising share price as the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, we can tell retail trading has increased by the interest people have expressed in their Google search bars.</description>

      <description>We’re in the midst of a great, if somewhat semantic, debate about waves. Given a swift increase in the number of new COVID-19 cases each day across a large number of US states in June, commentators have sounded the alarm that The Second Wave is now upon us.

      <description>I have recently donated to the Real Justice PAC, which works to elect reform-minded prosecutors at the county and municipal level, and encourage you to consider also donating.     Last week’s US nonfarm payrolls report caused a lot of head scratching, as it showed total employment increased by 2.5 million jobs in May despite a range of other data points leading up to the report that suggested the economy continued to hemorrhage jobs last month.</description>

      <description>There surely isn’t a country right now whose people aren’t collectively wondering when things will be totally back to normal, and whether things can ever be the kind of normal they were before.
