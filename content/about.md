My name is Ben Bakkum, and I'm the author of Macro Chronicles. I currently work on the data team at GiveDirectly, a nonprofit that operates cash transfer and basic income programs across seven countries in Africa and has provided disaster relief in the US, Puerto Rico, and the Bahamas.

Prior to GiveDirectly, I worked on the Private Bank Chief Investment Officer's team at J.P. Morgan, where I contributed to macroeconomic and global financial market research and analysis. I've passed all three levels of the Chartered Financial Analyst Exams.

I hold a B.S. in Commerce with a concentration in Finance from the University of Virginia, graduating with highest distinction in a second major in History. My thesis on antebellum American history received a Harrison Undergraduate Research Award and the Bernard Peyton Chamberlain Memorial Prize in History. 

My analysis and data vizualizations are produced in R, and this is an [RBlogdown site](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) with tweaks made to the [Cocoa Enhanced Hugo theme](https://github.com/alexpghayes/cocoa-eh-blogdown).
