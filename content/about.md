My name is Ben Bakkum, and I'm the author of Macro Chronicles. I live in Brooklyn and do investment research and portfolio management at a robo-advisor. All views expressed here are my own. 

Previously, I worked on the data team at [GiveDirectly](https://www.givedirectly.org/), a nonprofit that operates cash transfer and basic income programs around the world. Prior to GiveDirectly, I worked on the Private Bank Chief Investment Officer's team at J.P. Morgan, where I contributed to macroeconomic and global financial market research and analysis. I am a CFA® charterholder and a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ professional.

I hold a B.S. in Commerce with a concentration in Finance from the University of Virginia, graduating with highest distinction in a second major in History. My thesis on antebellum American history received a Harrison Undergraduate Research Award and the Bernard Peyton Chamberlain Memorial Prize in History. 

My analysis and data vizualizations are produced in R, and this is an [RBlogdown site](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) with tweaks made to the [Cocoa Enhanced Hugo theme](https://github.com/alexpghayes/cocoa-eh-blogdown), deployed with [Netflify](https://www.netlify.com/).
